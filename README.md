# book-console-service
MVC service for books library app

Docker image creation and running in docker container:
1. Install docker from docker.com 
2. Run the docker container to get deploy your service in that container
3. Add DockerFile
   1. FROM - Base Image (OpenJDK as Sprint Book app needs Java to run)
   2. ADD - To add your service's JAR file to get executed
   3. EXPOSE - Expose an PORT to access the Service URIs
   4. ENTRYPOINT - To run the Jar
4. Create Docker Build
   1. docker build -f DockerFile -t book-console-service .
       -f - DockerFile name
       -t - Tag for the image we can use versioning as well
5. Run docker image: > docker run -p 8081:8081 books-console-service
6. You may need to run >docker login to run the img

Monitoring:
https://www.callicoder.com/spring-boot-actuator-metrics-monitoring-dashboard-prometheus-grafana/
- Spring boot actuator will expose actuator endpoints to monitor service health and metrics
- Prometheus is external monitoring system to collect metrics periodically on given interval using micrometer registry micrometer-registry-prometheus
- After adding micrometer-registry-prometheus dependency and prometheus endpoint will get added with actuator
- Download and run prometheus using docker image 
- Download the image > docker pull prom/prometheus
- Add prometheus.yml configuration to allow prometheus server to scrape/pull the metrics data update HOST_IP as network ip where the service is running, localhost will not work, get IPdetails from ipconfig->ipv4 address in windows
- Run the Prometheus server > docker run -d --name=prometheus -p 9090:9090 -v C:\Users\Aparna\Documents\GitHub\books-console-service\prometheus.yml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml prom/prometheus --config.file=/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
- After this we can access the prometheus dashboard with http://localhost:9090/
- Change the management.server.port back to 8080 then only prometheus will fetch the metrics data
- Few queries examples for prometheus:
- http_server_requests_seconds_max{method="GET", uri=~"/books.+"}  //Search all uris starts with /books
- http_server_requests_seconds_max{uri="/home"} for /home exact match
- http_server_requests_seconds_count{method="GET"}
- Grafana: To pull metrics from prometheus ( it may directly be use for the app not sure yet)
- Download and run Grafana local server using docker image > docker run -d --name=grafana -p 3000:3000 grafana/grafana
- To check if container is available > docker container ls
- After this you can access grafana dashboard with http://localhost:3000/ uri
- use default login cred as admin/admin
- Add Datasource as prometheus from the dashboard->datasource->prometheus option
- Define prometheus URI as IPAddress:9090, IP is same as your machine IP, localhost will not work
- Kill docker all containers > docker kill $(docker ps -q)  
- The docker ps command will list all running containers. The -q flag will only list the IDs for those containers. Once we have the list of all container IDs, we can simply run the docker kill command, passing all those IDs, and theyâ€™ll all be stopped!
